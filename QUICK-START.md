# AlterX - Quick start tutorial

On Windows all AlterX dependencies can be installed by double clicking the shipped installer script: *maintenance\win-install-dependencies.cmd*

For Debian Linux users the script *maintenance/deb-dependencies-install.sh* installs all required and optional runtime and build dependencies.
Linuxcnc RT-componets can be installed by running *maintenance/comp_install.sh* script.

Start the GUI by invoking `alterx-gui` on Linux, `alterx.cmd` on Windows.
